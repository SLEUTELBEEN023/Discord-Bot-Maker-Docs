# Running via Command Prompt
This allows you to run your bot outside of DBM using command prompt (aka CMD). Please remember when you close the window the bot will shut down.
1. Open project directory
2. Click into the address bar
3. At the beginning type "cmd" and hit enter (this will open a cmd prompt in this folder)
4. type `node bot.js` <br/>Note: If you use a restart script (see [Restarting Automatically](#running-your-bot-247-restarting-automatically) this step may be different)
