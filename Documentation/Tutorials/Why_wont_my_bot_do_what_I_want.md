# Why won't my bot do what I am telling it to do.
You may have created a command that it can't interpret, or there is a corrupted file in the folder.  

**The first thing you should do is check your bot's log** (under the Project menu, choose Open Bot Log) and see what sort of errors it gives you. Often the error will tell you exactly what the problem is. Some errors can be found [here](https://silversunset.net/dbm/troubleshooting) with their resolutions.  

If the bot is still not working as expected after you've checked the log and attempted to troubleshoot, you can ask in the `support` channel of the main DBM guild (or the DBM Mods guild if your error relates to a mod).  

** To get a good answer from the helpers in Discord** you should provide the following information:  

* What is your command. **Example:** `My command is !ping`  
* What is your command supposed to do. **Example:** `It is supposed to tell me the ping of the bot in milliseconds`  
* What is it *actually* doing. **Example:** `Instead, it is saying "false"`  
* What does your bots log show. **Example:** `I checked my bot log and it says "client is not defined"`
