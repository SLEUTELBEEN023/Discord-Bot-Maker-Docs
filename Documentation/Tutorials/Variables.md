[DBM Tutorial - Obtaining Parameters >](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haAyykGaY_E)

There are a few ways to store and reuse information in DBM.

* **Temp variable** - exists only for the duration of the command. Once the command action list is over the variable is 'forgotten' by the bot
* **Server variable** - exists for a single server. The bot will 'remember' these variables between commands but only for the server they were created in.
* **Global variable** - exists for the bot regardless of server or command.
